# Notes

1. What about a11y will we focus on for the honor's thesis?
   1. possibly making musiccpr accessibile to people with visual impairments
      1. flat.io
         1. according to https://blog.flat.io/flat-for-education-accessible-features/ they don't support braille or screen readers right now
      2. check the behavior of common screenreaders in musiccpr activities
         1. maybe compare/contrast to behavior with musescore and with straight up flat.io?
            1. https://jmu-cime.github.io/flatio-playground/variations.html
               1. for narrator, NVDA, and VoiceOVer, it seems like maybe the controls in flat.io embeds are accessible to some degree, but the score region of the editor is unknown to the assistive techs (ATs)
      3. check the behavior of braille displays in musiccpr activities
1. think of other a11y things we are interested in.
   1. a11y wrt students who use adaptive instruments (which likely send either keyboard events or midi "events"/messages to their computer and their computer is running an app that notices this and makes sound from their speakers)
      1. if this student uses the same computer that is their instrument to login to musiccpr, they would have to already have audio routing software and maybe a discrete sound crd in order to be able to pipe the audio output directly into the browser's recording input...
      2. what if we let them tell us they're already doing MIDI and not sue that instead of the microphone?
         1. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_MIDI_API
      3. if they are using an instrument that is a keyboard controller instead of a midi controller, what would we do?
         1. reach out to Dr. Rathgeber here? http://www.jesserathgeber.com/ 

# Action Items

1. Contact flat.io to ask if we can make a contribution (cc stewart)?
   1. hello@flat.io
2. adaptive instruments: reach out (cc stewart) to Dr. Rathgeber here? http://www.jesserathgeber.com/
3. do a demo where you sign in to musiccpr on your phone and then play spotify or play your midi keyboard and have the computer speaker audio get picked up by your phone microphone (you should wear headphones that are connected to your phone to hear the accompaniment that starts playing when you start recording)
   1. or maybe before testing with musiccpr, test with your phone on https://mdn.github.io/dom-examples/media/web-dictaphone/ and then check musiccpr next?
4. try a demo of webmidi to see how/whether it captures your midi keyboard?
